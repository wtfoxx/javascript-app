# Pokedex App

##### This is my first JavaScript project. 
It consists of a Pokedex app that will retrieve information from an API to display on a usable app. It uses JS, HTML and CSS, and with external libraries like Bootstrap and JQuery, it ensures a better looking and smoother performing app. 
You can search for any pokemon on the top right!
